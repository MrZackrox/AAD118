 Imaging and Data Visualisation
 ------------------------------
 
This modual is all about use starting to look at everything with wider eyes. We are starting to look at how everything can effect the outcome of a project from the type that is used to the placing of images. We are looking into photography and thinkg about how the subject matter can be affected by the angle of the photograph and so on. Then the next step it to look at illustrating book covers. With this we are even more so trying to look at ever aspects. As we want to keep the covers connected in some way this could be from the font to the colours used on them. Then we will be lastly looking at how to convay data in a visual way with inforgraphis. We will need to think how we can best represent the data in a clear and meaninful way so that the viewer is left with a clear understanding of the subject of the inforgraphic.  
 
 
 Research for Project 3- Infographic
 -----------------------------------------------
 
So the finial project for this module is an infographic about the world population. This project is not just about making an infographic its about how we can convey date and facts in a visual way, but I shall get into that later on. We have been given a link to data that we can us in the infographic but we can also go out and source our own information from the web for the infographic. The link that we were given took use to [Worldmeters] (ttp://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). This was extreamly helpful as the data was updating everyday and it even went into detail about the number that you saw.

The Start
---------

In the begging I couldn’t really come up with an idea but though it didn’t take long for ideas to start flowing. This was around the time that I started to do some research into other infographic’s and how data can be visual represented and it has been a tonne of help in the idea storming for the project.

I am going to start this research of by looking at data visualization projects as these are in the same area as what we are doing but they can differ in how they look so much its hard to see what I can adapt into this project. I know I could make a website and have it interactive which would be amazing but I am not at that level yet.  Once I started to look for projects I couldn’t stop finding amazing detailed ones, so I have had to make the hard decision of not writing about them all. Though thinking about it now it doesn’t seem that bad.  

I was actually prepared for this project as I funnily enough had bookmarked some links for interesting projects a long time ago and forgot they existed like everyone does with the dam bookmarks.

I would like to say that I have wrote about a lot of web based infographics so there won't be any images for some parts.

One of the first projects that I looked at was for The New York Times by Jeremy Ashkenas and Alicia Parlapiano who look at [How the Recession Reshaped the Economy, in 255 Charts] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html?abt=0002&abg=1e). What in particular made this an interesting project is how much data that they had to trawl through, I fell this is what make most of these project great. As they are more likely to be complex in how they will be seen visually as there is going to be so much data. With this project I like a few parts of it and some I think don’t work, as I said earlier most now a day are websites and interactive and I fell this is were it works for this project.

You have this real nice flow of information getting presented to you even though it’s so vast and complex yet sense it presented in this manner you can take it in easier.  In this project they have done that by making it a one page website were you just have to scroll to certain parts to get different information and I fell this works as you get the sense that you are evolved with the data as you gradually get fed it and you can relate back to it at later points on the website. 

The main visual representation of the data is what I call squiggly lines and to me this look nice but also looks very daunting for some one trying to find information about a certain chart, they have also thought this as at the end they lose this and split them up and give you facts and figures for each line. One of the things I realised and they probably did as well but I saw that in the middle of the mess of squiggly lines you can’t really pick out a certain one as a box appears and hides most of them in the vicinity of your pointer. 

I fell that I have looked at for long enough now so it time to move onto the next project that fancies my tickle. This next project is one of the nicer ones that I have seen and I fell that it might be because it is on paper. It is titled [Everyone Ever In The World] (http://theluxuryofprotest.com/Everyone_Ever_in_the_World.html).This is the first one that I have saw on a big scale not to be done in the form of a website which was very refreshing. The project is about the amount of people that have existed compared to those who have been killed in genocide, massacres and wars during humankinds recorded history.

To start with I just love how the data has been represented in this circle/spiral formation. To me it seems like it is some sort of futuristic code/graphic or there is a code in it and you have to decode it and save the world. I think this would make a very cool animated graphic for a futuristic move were it spins and lines up to reveal some sort of code or it can just look cool spinning. 

You have the dots in the top left and these represent the dramatic increase in the number of conflicts. I like how it is a dot that is used to represent this as to me it symbolise the hole that we are leaving in our universe when we fight. Then on top of this I feel that the spiral shows how we are spiralling inwards to our own destruction when in fact we should be expanding out. Over all I like how the information is laid out but I fell it is a bit hard to read at some times but I fell that it’s meant to have a visual impact which it is does. It does this with the use of the circle as on the out skirts you have little information then it gets really dense over time. I would like to point of the bottom circle, this is meant to be a guess at what the future will hold in terms of conflict.

On my search for inspiration I found a lot of epic infographic’s, this one in particular I found interesting as its similar to an idea that I had for how to do this infographic. You can find that idea on down a bit. The website is a map of the Internet and cleverly titled [The Internet Map] (http://internet-map.net/#5-146.76316247285695-93.80676523420433). It visually shows every single website that on the Internet. I like this infographic as well because it ties in with what we were learning last semester. It uses one of the basic building blocks. So visually you have each country represent by a colour. For example Russia is red. Then to simply show which site gets the most traffic for that country the size of the circle gets bigger.

![The Internet Map](http://visualizing.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/embedded_vis_medium/images/map_0.png)

I like how it looks similar to how cave men splattered/ sprayed paint on walls to signify something. The only part I dis like about this infographic is the fact that when you click on a circle a window pops up telling you about said circle. Then when you click on another one it stays open. I feel that it should really disappear once you click on another circle.  I would love to see this as a live infographic, as it would a most be pulsing like a heart beat and the movement of the circles would be like a leaf in the wind.

I was looking for projects that were out there a bit and happily I came across [The Solar Annual Report] (https://www.behance.net/gallery/The-Solar-Annual-Report-powered-by-the-sun/2986075). This project is about showing the data in clear and easy manner to understand in book form. But they added an interesting twist to it. Sense this is the solar annual Report the pages light sensitive. So when you are in door you will find that the pages are blank and show now information. I wonder if holding it over a candle would show anything. So you have to be out in the sun to enjoy the information that in contained in the pages of the report.

I just find this idea of using what the report is about in direct correlation with the project itself. I started to wonder that is there anything I could do with this project in a similar way to theirs. I thought that you could have the infographic fit a globe and you have to spin it to read everything that there is on it.

Then I came to the idea of having a website were there is just the world map and hen you hover over a certain country you get information about that particular country. It would be similar to the one you showed use about the tweets. With key information all ways being displayed some were on the page i.e. total population etc. This would all be live to resemble how chaotic the world is. It might even be interesting to combine the twitter, the one that shows flights etc and you can chose what to see and if you want to see them all at once you can. 

I haven’t even got to how nice the data is laid out, throughout the report. They have used are really appealing colour pallet for the report. I would say that the colours are earthy tones which helps tie in the fact that the report is about the earth. You then have a really nice font that has been used through out the report. The information is clear and feels important on each page as you can see below.

![The Solar Annual Report](https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/23020759/disp/b994e0f6c495a5202fdeb059b6822ff5.jpg?cb=1945039031)

Sense looking at this project I went down a path of looking at similar types of projects. The one I am about to quickly write about isn’t visualizing any data but it is still an epic idea.

This project came from the World Press Photo and is titled Speaking Images 2015. Once I looked at it I was totally entreated by the idea of the project. It is a book of the best photographs of 2015 with someone narrating them for you. Once you open the book a speaker is activated and it starts to tell you about the image you are looking at. This to me is just a really nice idea that brings more of an impact to the viewer of the book. 

The book also looks extremely nice. The cover for the book just says what is waiting in side for the viewer, with it subtly using sound waves to show this book has more to offer that most other photography books. Then I like the colour scheme that is used as the photos that are showen in the book are about death and the bad things that we bring to the world. So the colour scheme of the cover shouts this to the viewer with it being black and the spin being red as you can see in the image below.

![Speak Images 2015](https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/170107625/max_1200/107b7420496cad6c64c8823ca655051d.jpg?cb=1945039031)

I then went from this project to another one that is again, epic. It is a web based project that is more tied to visually representing facts. This project is called [Troy Davis- I am alive](https://www.behance.net/gallery/7928869/Troy-Davis-I-am-alive). You get brought to a page were you are immediately brought into the experience of the whole project as the story starts as soon as the page loads. You then have to interact with page to carry on the story. 

You then go through the story of Davis in a visually impactive drawn story. The whole time you are on edge, as you are getting brought through a mans life which ended in him being sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit.

I love the simplicity of the drawing yet the have so much impact in them its crazy. I feel that this is through the use of colour that gives them this impact. It could be because it black vs white that in return represents good vs evil. This is then what this whole story is about. That now person should be sentenced to death for a crime that they have committed.  The other nice touch to the project is using his writing as a tool to signify the when the death penalty was used wrongly.

I then started to look at just normal inforgraphic, though at this time I all ready had a good idea of what I was going for. Below you can see one of the first  few infographics that I found. It is to do with food waste as I am going to have a section of my infographic look at this problem that is getting worse as we are becoming more.

![Learn Six Sigma Project](http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/018/0/a/food_waste_infographic_by_roshipotoshi-d5rujzy.png)

I really like this infographic I fell that it is easy to understand and you can follow what you are being told easily enough with the use of the graphics that are used throughout it. What I am seeing here is that they have broke up there infographic into section by using a single dashed line. I all ready have an idea of what I want to do. But this seems like an other way that I could have done it with it being effective as well. 

The whole feel of the infographic works for me, you have these nice colours that were used and the don't clash with eachother so they are easy on the eyes. You then have the use of the text throughout the infographic which looks nice and is prositioned well beside the graphic that they are explaining. I like the use of different colours of words to draw attention to certain things more. I was thinking of using red and I shall as seeing this it makes what is highlited stand out the most.

This next one I just like the look of it and I think it as a whole works perfectly, you can see it below.

I just like the simplicity of the layout for this infographic and you really coudld use this idea to show case a lot of other world population facts. I love how it show the chaos that might happen in the sky with the crazy lines that are  around the centre graphic.

![Airbus Infographic](http://www.industryweek.com/site-files/industryweek.com/files/uploads/2013/09/airbus%20infographic.jpg)

Then everthing else just works for the it. The type is nice and clear you have a nice colour scheme to go with it. Even though the colour for the main parts is so simple this is good as it draw attention to the more important information. Then I also just really like the landmarks that they have made.

This will be the last one that I am going to write about as I could be here for years going through all the ones that I have found to draw inspiration from.

This last one I actually found after the fact when I started my own idea as research never ends. I write this as if I had saw it before hand it could have made me go down a different path for my infographic.

So below you can see that there is not much to the infographic but it looks extremly well done. Everthing works perfectly in this from the colour to the font that was used.

![Steven Gastelum- World Population Facts](http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/world-population-stats_52cca1d5a8f5e_w1500.png)

What I like most about it. Is that it takes you one a journy and follows the way we read books. Right from the start your eyes move along and absorb the information at hand.

So it times for me to move past the research stage and make a start on my own infographic. Though as I wrote before the research stage is never over.


Bit about my own Idea
--------------------

The next couple of days after hearing what the project was, ideas were swirling about my head in a never-ending loop. Some got thrown out of the loop as they were above the realm of what I could do.

One of these ideas was to have a website. This website is just going to house circles which are big and small. These circles will be grouped into different sections. At the start they will be on top of each other and once you hover over one section it will expand and the circles will fly to the outside of the biggest circle. The biggest circle will be the year that has the most of what that section is about and it will house a bit of information about that year. Then it will be the same with the smaller circles. The bigger one could be a future prediction.

I have had a few other ideas but I fell that this idea would be the nicest looking one if I choose a nice colour scheme and type.

When I had got my head out of the clouds. I thought of an idea that I really liked. It’s in the style of a normal inforgraphic with the height being longer. As you can see in the image below, I want to take the viewer on a story through facts about the world population. I wanted to go for then vs now facts. At the start this seemed like a good idea but when I started to bring my ideas into Illustrator I ran into problems.

Below you can see the quick sketchs that I done before I went on into Illustrator. I had my idea more and less thoughout as you can see below. The then vs now idea came pretty quickly to me as its the first thing I wrote and it then effected everything after that.

<img src="project_3/sketch_1.jpg" atl="Sketch for infographic"/>

<img src="project_3/sketch_2.jpg" atl="Sketch for infographic"/>

I wanted to have the globe some were at the top as this inforgraphic is about world population facts. A globe will visually tell that viewer what this inforgraphic is about. So I was thinking of having the globe in the middle and then the title rapping around it. You can sort of see this in the photo below.

In this photo you can see the then vs now style that I was going to go for. I wanted to have it separated down the middle. I would then have a fact from years ago on the left side. On the right we would see how much the fact has change in the number of years passed.

For the colours I wanted to go for green and blue. I choose these colours, as they are related to earth more so than any other colour. Also sense I am using the globe to draw in the viewers I wanted to bring the colour from that and spread it out.

You can see in the below photo the first attempts at bringing my idea to life. At the time I liked were I was going with the feel of the infographic. I know there is not much there. Though you get to see the ideas that I had come together. 

I like the title part so far of the inforgraphic as is says all what the infographic has to offer.

So this is the next and last time. That I remembered it would be a good idea to save what I was doing as a draft. As you can see at this stage I am still with the old idea, and looking back at it I wish I could have gotten it to work. 

So the to section has more and less stayed the same with just a few new additions to it. These additions just hep people understand what each graphic is worth.

I then thought to take them on a journey visually it would be good to us colour to do this as well. I broke fact into sections and then just gave them a darker tone of the colour above.  I felt that this would sub make it a higher chance that they read the whole inforgraphic as everything is trying to bring the eye down.

I nearly got this idea finished but I realised that it was over cluttered and that the graphics didn’t stand out that much. I was too constricted with the sizing of the inforgraphic. Before I moved on I did change the height of each section but looking back on it I should have also changed the width and this idea might of worked our.

I do like the lay out of the content in the inforgraphic as it was meant to seem like a mirrored image almost but just a few more on the ‘now’ side. If I had done this better I feel that it would have looked nice in the end. At one point I was thinking about giving the graphics similar colours to the background. I can see now that this was a bad idea as it takes away the visual impact that you would get from the graphics it they were a different colour.

So this is were this idea got binned for just facts about the world population now. I feel that this was for the best as I done more with the graphics and it seems to flow better that this idea did.

Writing about this older version now, I feel a bit silly as I probably could have gotten it to work but I just didn’t try hard enough with it.

It isn’t till I start to move on when I realise that my idea needs to be tweaked a little.
