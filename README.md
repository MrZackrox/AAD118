 Research for Project 1- Macro and Micro Photography.
 
 To start of this project I done a  healthy bit of research into other photographers in the field of each category. I was happy when I heard that we were doing a photography project as I love to take photographs given that I dont do it as far often as I should. I would like to start at least once a week going out and taking photographs of nature and other subjects that capture my attention. As I fell that this will give me a better eye in choosing what goes into the end "frame" of what ever I am doing. What I mean by this is that it doesn't matter what you are doing you bahve to see how every thing act amd mixes with each other this can be a piece of text to the prosition of the photograph that you take.
 
 So to start with I wanted to look at marco photography. Actualy before I start I fell like the term macro should not be used for this category as macro is more and less the same as micro photography just a bit further away.
