 Research for Project 1- Macro and Micro Photography.
 
 To start of this project I done a  healthy bit of research into other photographers in the field of each category. I was happy when I heard that we were doing a photography project as I love to take photographs given that I dont do it as far often as I should. I would like to start at least once a week going out and taking photographs of nature and other subjects that capture my attention. As I fell that this will give me a better eye in choosing what goes into the end "frame" of what ever I am doing. What I mean by this is that it doesn't matter what you are doing you bahve to see how every thing act amd mixes with each other this can be a piece of text to the prosition of the photograph that you take.
 
 So to start with I wanted to look at marco photography. Actualy before I start I fell like the term macro should not be used for this category as macro is more and less the same as micro photography just a bit further away. So I done a bit of Googleing and saw this, 
 
 <img src="project_1/micro-example.jpg" atl="Example Image of Micro Photography"/>
 <img src="project_1/macro-example.jpg" atl="Example Image of Macro Photography"/>


as you can see they are the same more and less the same. The only reason I say that is because in the macro one you can only see the flys eyes not the rest of it. But this is not landscape photograpghy, unless we are meant to take photos of really small buildings.

Any ways that is just a thought that I had on the matter and I keep forgetting to bring it up when I see you, so I thought this would be as a good any place to bring it up.

Macro (Landscape)
=================

With this adventure rightly on it way I started to look for photographers that when I seen their images I felt something that I can' really describe, it just happens when I see a photo I really like.

So I first got this fillen when looking at a photographer named [Mike Curry](http://www.mikecurryphotography.com/portfolio). I fell like he is not the most knowen photographer but he has reall nice photos up on his website.

The first one which caught my atttion was a photograph he took of the melemion Dome with a long exposure. Some how I all way find my way back to long exposure photography. Well any ways as you can see the image it sell is very caothic but thats what I like about it you have this sense of excitment in the photograph that you would not get without a longer exposure. Saying that it is not overly long I would say only about 4 seconds at the most as if any long things would start you burn out. Then this is what give you that sense of crazyness as you can still clearly see the dome and make out some of the buildings but you have that haze over laying it. I just like the diference in the photos as most would just be happy with shooting it with a normal exposure but I fell like this give of the vibe that London is a busy inviroment (which it is).

I also like this photo as it is similir to what I want to achive with my chosen subject for my photographs. with this photograph you fell like you are looking through a protal into another world with the board of leaves that you have around the photograph. Not only this the subject is  centered in the photograph on the x axis which shows it impotance in the photograph. Though as I have said it is not completely centered in the photograph with the y axis being different. You have more of the sky in the image, now why has he chosen this who knows. It might be to show the hight of the structure how it nearlly the sky and towers over its natural surroundings, well its thats one reason why he might have I could spend longer looking at this guy and I might come back and wright about another photograph of his but I fell the ship a calling to start with the next photographer that I have in ready.


The next photorapher that I got onto is just a wizard but instead of having a wand/ staff he has a camera. Well he might not be a wizard but he is still very skilled with a camera. How I know this is that one of his photographs has won the landscape photographer of the year, with this image;


Now that you have taken a moment to completly emeres yourself into the photgraph it is time to come back. As this is what happened to me when I first saw the photograph I got lost in the endless tonnes of the image chassing something that wasn't there. What got me the most about this photgrpah is that it looks like an oil painting to me its the good. You then get this felling when looking at the photograph, like something eiry is about to happen, with the ever on setting fog that is coming into lie for the night. Then you have this stream to the left hand side of the photograph which helps break the photograph up, this is not including the different tonnes of the nature in the photo. Any ways back to the stream you have this contrasting colour in this photograph wich grabs you attetion and starts the journey when looking at the photograph.
