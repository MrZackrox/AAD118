 Imaging and Data Visualisation
 ------------------------------
 
This modual is all about use starting to look at everything with wider eyes. We are starting to look at how everything can effect the outcome of a project from the type that is used to the placing of images. We are looking into photography and thinkg about how the subject matter can be affected by the angle of the photograph and so on. Then the next step it to look at illustrating book covers. With this we are even more so trying to look at ever aspects. As we want to keep the covers connected in some way this could be from the font to the colours used on them. Then we will be lastly looking at how to convay data in a visual way with inforgraphis. We will need to think how we can best represent the data in a clear and meaninful way so that the viewer is left with a clear understanding of the subject of the inforgraphic.  
 
 
 Research for Project 2- Ilustrated Book Covers.
 -----------------------------------------------
 
 So for this porject I was a bit on the fence with it as I have all ready done this last year so I felt like I was back in that mindset. I couldn't get last years idea out of my head for a few day and now that I have actually read the Hobbit and am currently reading The Lord Of The Rings I fell that I could do it more justice than I did my first time. Though I fell that it would be hard for me to get away from what I went for with the covers last time. So I am going to just have to get on with a new idea.
 
I was sitting there in class doing some searching of genres and other books that could possibably be up my ally. When I was doing this Richard Weston aka [Acejet170](http://www.acejet170.typepad.com/) came over and had a chat with me about all kind of different books. What this did was get my mind of the actualy task and let it breath for a moment as I throughing to many logs on it and it was goind out. So after the chat we had I felt something coming back to me about a movie that I watched not to long ago. This movie was Foxcatcher and I would maybe stop reading now if you haven't watched the movie as I am going to spole the ending (sorry).

You watched it yet?
-------------------

So the idea that I had when I had just left the cinema was actually a poster idea but I am going to adapt it into a book cover and if it turns out ok I might then turn it into a poster. So the idea that I have is to have the gun that John du Pont shot, which is a magmuin .44 long barrle. It won't be the gun but a yellow cut out almost if you understand me. Then for the smoke trail I was thinking of having it mak up a fox almost like caught the fox. This is the idea that then brought the genre about which I fell like it the thriller genre.

So now that I have the genre I can now start branching out and two other covers todo. With the idea for the foxcatcher cover I felt like it should be yellow and blue as that was the colours of there wrestling outfits were. Then the only text on the covers would be the title and the author. The two other covers at the moment I want to do is one for the movie Nightcrawler and mayby a cover for Fargo. I am not so sure about Fargo as I can not think of anything good to illustrate, but with Nightcrawler I fell like just having tire tracks on the cover would be cool.

Thats enough of that now its time for some research, I fell like I am going to be a bit out of my depths as I don't really read thrillers but I am really just looking at the covers so that might really matter.

As all ways I have went on a massive Google search to see what book covers I can draw inspiration from. Sense my genre is thriller I will focuse on book covers from there but will branch out to find book covers from serises. Below you can see why I have picked this book cover and if you can not its because theres a gun on the cover. I looked at this because it is similar to what I want to have for one of the book covers that I am doing. I like how plain it is everywhere else apart from the gun, I fell this tells the viewer that this story will centre around murders that happen by a gun man. I also like the colours used as they represent death, fear and will evoke this in the viewer.

This was one of the first serise of book covers that is found with a similar stlye in them. I really like these as I fell that they represent the books perfectly. The illustrations are the title of the books illustrated in a clever way, usually you don't see this, you just get an illustration from the book itself. So whats similar is the style of illustration and the use of vibrant colours to convey the tone of the book. I like the gritiness and roughness you get from the covers as this is tells you the story will be similar to this.

What I like about this book cover is the type, as thats all there is. You could debate that they have took the type to another level and sort of turned it into an illustation. I like the crack that runs throught the word 'psycho' as to me it  can represent the crack in a persons brain that makes them a psycho. You then have the very basic colour scheme used for the book which helps 'psycho' stand out and seem important. I nearlly forgot about this but I love that that psycho is turned around to fit the whole length of the book.

This was just a fun project that [Sharm Murugiah](http://www.sharmmurugiah.com/) done with nine movies that Quentin Tarantino has made. Sense I have watched most of the movies I can get all the little parts about the cover. As if you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs it could be a bit confussing to why there are so many hands in different colour on the covers. Then what made me pick this set of book covers is that they have a theme running through out them.

I stumbled apon this book cover and it then threw the movie back into my face as I fell that it represents the moive is such a uniqe way. I like that there is just a little bit of womens hair on the cover sugesting that she is just out of sight that or may be someone was taking a phoyograph and miss framed the shot. Then the use of colour on the cover is very nice indeed, it sets you up to be tricked into thinkong that the girl is inocent as her hair is white and that there is evil around her.

For thsi book cover I have had a similir ideas for my book cover but I fell like it would be hard to pull of for a one of the covers maybe even them all. Any ways I just liked the added level of detail that was put into the cover, I have not read the book. But to  me this cover could be saying that the main potaginist is someone who has a split personality of some kind. What leads me to think this is that is is filled with darkness on the front cover but on the back she is filled with rage and so on. With just righting that last sentance this could represnt how the carachter evolves throughout the book. Like at the start there is danger all around her but she is relitivity safe but in the end it engulfs her.

What drew me to these book covers was that they looked so unique and interesting. I found it interesting that the illustations were made up of dots, as this is what we looked at last semester. I love the use of interestin and vibrant colours, which is draw in the viewers attetion. You then have the continuity through out the covers like the placment of the illustation and of the text.
