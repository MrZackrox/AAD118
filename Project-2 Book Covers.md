 Imaging and Data Visualisation
 ------------------------------
 
This modual is all about use starting to look at everything with wider eyes. We are starting to look at how everything can effect the outcome of a project from the type that is used to the placing of images. We are looking into photography and thinkg about how the subject matter can be affected by the angle of the photograph and so on. Then the next step it to look at illustrating book covers. With this we are even more so trying to look at ever aspects. As we want to keep the covers connected in some way this could be from the font to the colours used on them. Then we will be lastly looking at how to convay data in a visual way with inforgraphis. We will need to think how we can best represent the data in a clear and meaninful way so that the viewer is left with a clear understanding of the subject of the inforgraphic.  
 
 
 Research for Project 2- Ilustrated Book Covers.

 So for this porject I was a bit on the fence with it as I have all ready done this last year so I felt like I was back in that mindset. I couldn't get last years idea out of my head for a few day and now that I have actually read the Hobbit and am currently reading The Lord Of The Rings I fell that I could do it more justice than I did my first time. Though I fell that it would be hard for me to get away from what I went for with the covers last time. So I am going to just have to get on with a new idea.
 
I was sitting there in class doing some searching of genres and other books that could possibably be up my ally. When I was doing this Richard Weston aka [Acejet170](http://www.acejet170.typepad.com/) came over and had a chat with me about all kind of different books. What this did was get my mind of the actualy task and let it breath for a moment as I throughing to many logs on it and it was goind out. So after the chat we had I felt something coming back to me about a movie that I watched not to long ago. This movie was Foxcatcher and I would maybe stop reading now if you haven't watched the movie as I am going to spole the ending (sorry).

You watched it yet?
-------------------

So the idea that I had when I had just left the cinema was actually a poster idea but I am going to adapt it into a book cover and if it turns out ok I might then turn it into a poster. So the idea that I have is to have the gun that John du Pont shot, which is a magmuin .44 long barrle. It won't be the gun but a yellow cut out almost if you understand me. Then for the smoke trail I was thinking of having it mak up a fox almost like caught the fox. This is the idea that then brought the genre about which I fell like it the thriller genre.

So now that I have the genre I can now start branching out and two other covers todo. With the idea for the foxcatcher cover I felt like it should be yellow ans blue as that was the colours of there wrestling outfits.
