 Imaging and Data Visualisation
 
 If you want to see my images you can go to my [flickr] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/117329603@N05/collections/72157650863596651/) page were there are. I have also wrote a bit about them in the description most of them, well may be just the finial ones.
 
 
 Research for Project 1- Macro and Micro Photography.
 
 To start of this project I done a  healthy bit of research into other photographers in the field of each category. I was happy when I heard that we were doing a photography project as I love to take photographs given that I don't do it as far often as I should. I would like to start at least once a week going out and taking photographs of nature and other subjects that capture my attention. As I fell that this will give me a better eye in choosing what goes into the end "frame" of what ever I am doing. What I mean by this is that it doesn't matter what you are doing you have to see how everything acts and mixes with each other this can be a piece of text to the position of the photograph that you take.
 
 So to start with I wanted to look at macro photography. Actually before I start I fell like the term macro should not be used for this category as macro is more and less the same as micro photography just a bit further away. So I done a bit of Goggling and saw this, 
 
 <img src="project_1/micro-example.jpg" atl="Example Image of Micro Photography"/>
 <img src="project_1/macro-example.jpg" atl="Example Image of Macro Photography"/>


as you can see they are the same more and less the same. The only reason I say that is because in the macro one you can only see the fly's eyes not the rest of it. But this is not landscape photography, unless we are meant to take photos of really small buildings.

Any ways that is just a thought that I had on the matter and I keep forgetting to bring it up when I see you, so I thought this would be as a good any place to bring it up.

Before I go on at write about the type of photographs that we are taking I think it would be best to brush up on our photography knowledge. So there are many components that make a good photograph but it really depends on what effects you are trying to get.
Composition is one of the more conmen ones that you will us to make your photograph have that impact that you want. There are many different things that you can do with the composition but here are just a few that I know of;

Rule of thirds- So this is really what composition is but you can do different things with it to get different effects. As you can see in the image below this has been set up using the rule of thirds, the red lines is what you would see on the view finder of you camera if you set it up to show it. Though after a while if you get us to it you can start to just tell were to position the object in the photograph. 

![Rule of Thirds](http://mrs-cook.weebly.com/uploads/2/3/0/6/23067164/____7388181_orig.jpg)

So with this photograph they have used the rule of thirds to add more to the photograph. As you are now thinking what is the dear looking at. Then on the y axis you have it set up so that you can see more of the sky than the ground. I fell this is just because it look more interesting and that the object stand out more in the depth of the sky.

So when you start to us the composition more you can start to us it in interesting ways to create depth and make the photograph more interesting. The photograph above is just sticking to the basics of the rule of thirds. So you can start to use it to create even more interesting shots and then you can add a shallow focus and so on to highlight the main part of the photograph. Like in this photograph below, were you have a basic example of what you can do with using different focus point.

There is a lot that you can do in photography to make you photographs that bit nicer and interesting even if the viewer can't tell what you have done subconsciously they will like it better.

Macro (Landscape)
=================

With this adventure rightly on it way I started to look for photographers that when I seen their images I felt something that I can' really describe, it just happens when I see a photo I really like.

So I first got this filling when looking at a photographer named [Mike Curry](http://www.mikecurryphotography.com/portfolio). I fell like he is not the most known photographer but he has really nice photos up on his website.

The first one which caught my attention was a photograph he took of the millennium Dome with a long exposure. Some how I all way find my way back to long exposure photography. Well any ways as you can see the image it sell is very chaotic but that's what I like about it you have this sense of excitement in the photograph that you would not get without a longer exposure. Saying that it is not overly long I would say only about 4 seconds at the most as if any long things would start you burn out. Then this is what give you that sense of craziness as you can still clearly see the dome and make out some of the buildings but you have that haze over laying it. I just like the difference in the photos as most would just be happy with shooting it with a normal exposure but I fell like this give of the vibe that London is a busy environment (which it is).

I also like this photograph as it is similar to what I want to achieve with my chosen subject for my photographs. With this photograph you fell like you are looking through a portal into another world with the board of leaves that you have around the photograph. Not only this the subject is centered in the photograph on the x axis which shows it importance in the photograph. Though as I have said it is not completely centered in the photograph with the y axis being different. You have more of the sky in the image, now why has he chosen this who knows. It might be to show the height of the structure how it nearly the sky and towers over its natural surroundings, well that's one reason why he might have I could spend longer looking at this guy and I might come back and write about another photograph of his but I fell the ship a calling to start with the next photographer that I have in ready.

The next photographer that I got onto is just a wizard but instead of having a wand/ staff he has a camera. Well he might not be a wizard but he is still very skilled with a camera. How I know this is that one of his photographs has won the landscape photographer of the year, with this image;

![Mike Curry](http://www.mikecurryphotography.com/assets/img/content/portfolio/greenwich-park-IRP6230139_1.jpg)

Now that you have taken a moment to completely immerse yourself into the photograph it is time to come back. As this is what happened to me when I first saw the photograph I got lost in the endless tonnes of the image chasing something that wasn't there. What got me the most about this photograph is that it looks like an oil painting to me its the good. You then get this felling when looking at the photograph, like something eiry is about to happen, with the ever on setting fog that is coming into lie for the night. Then you have this stream to the left hand side of the photograph which helps break the photograph up, this is not including the different tonnes of the nature in the photo. Going back to the stream you have this contrasting colour in this photograph which grabs you attention and starts the journey when looking at the photograph. 

When I was on my late night searching I got to see some fantastic photographers but the next two I fell that the camera is just a mere extention to themselves. I spent hours going down the rabbit hole just looking at this next photographer on his own. Who is the photographer?, you may be asking yourself. The photographer is [Ansel Adams](http://www.anseladams.com/), who is a legend in the field of landscape photography. I even like his story, as when he was just beginning in photography he needed to have someone there to tell him to go for it. Then this is when you saw Adams start to blossom into a great photographer as he had the ability to believe in what he was doing. This is what I also think lets people down their ability to believe in themselves to succeed in what they want to do, as in this case if it wasn't for someone else Adams might have never took photography serious.

He all most has to many great photographs to choose from, but most of them got discarded as I was looking for photographs that have a structure in them as this is what we are looking at.

As you can see the photograph is just perfect. It seems that he takes for ever to set up a just one photograph. I fell like this might be the issue because he used a really big camera and its not like what we have to day were the camera does most of the work for you. Anyways, what I like about this photograph in the positioning of the structure in the photograph. You have this dirt road which take up a lot of the photograph leading to this crystal white church, it just takes your eyes on this journey through the photograph. Then it is centered on the x axis as well which show the importance of the structure as well. I also like that the photograph is black and white it adds to the overall tone of the photograph. It gives the photographa sense of emptyness even though there is so much happening in it.

![Ansel Adams](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/.a/6a00df351e888f88340168e517a873970c-800wi)

Then this is another one of his photographs that I liked. As you have two structure battling for the spot light in the photograph. It seems that they are in a battle but the more I look at the photograph they work to gather to create the feeling of shelter all most with the for-ground structure sheltering the other structure. You then have this weird effect were it seem to not be centered but it's juxtaposed as the structures are of kilter.

Then the last landscape photographer that I am going to look at is [Charlie Waite](http://www.charliewaite.com/). Before I get into his photography I would just like to say that he has a very nice monogram indeed. It is just so simple but it works when you see it on his website and when you click through it.

I picked to of his photographs that I liked and this was hard once again but I managed. So with this photograph below I really like it because of it simplicity all it is is a photograph of a spiral stair case. Though you have this divide with the piller of the stairs running down the center of the photograph. Then on top of this I like the way he has only chosen to show a bit of the stairs and left out the floor. As to me I fell like this creates a tension in the photograph, with the stairs spiraling up to the light and spiraling down into the abyss.

Then the last photograph that I am going to look at of his is the one I like the most. As I fell that he has transformed this structure into a colossal mountain with the way he has captured it. He has took it from a low angle and you have the peak of the structure reaching to the blue of the sky just the way any mountain does. Then I love how he has separated the photograph into half with the use of the wall. Looking back at these photographs I just need. I muct mention the tones of colour in these photographs are just memorising and rich. The blue door in contrast with the crispness of the wall. Then you have the looming shadows of clouds boardering the wall which open up into a peakness of hope and prostarity.

Micro
====

I know that we are taking photographs but I fell that what I am about to talk about next is tied in with Microphotography. When I was doing some searching I remembered that most movies with complicated sets our actually miniature than real life. I actually can’t believe that I haven’t thought about this more often as one, I found really funny was that The Lord Of The Rings sets, and were miniature. I know for some reason it never clicked in my brain that there wasn't actually Barad-dur (the tower with the eye) in real life. I am not saying that I though Gondor was an actual place but I never just thought about it. I just wanted to bring up the level of micro filmography that goes into these fantastic movies and you sort of forget about it when watching it.

![Ansel Adams](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr02/7/15/enhanced-buzz-2209-1381173447-4.jpg)

I really just wanted to bring that up as in the movies the sets seem so big but yet they are tiny and I fell that you could so some nice microphotography around them. There is more than just Lord Of The Rings but I am reading it at the moment so I am a fan boy for the mean time.

![Ansel Adams](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr05/7/15/enhanced-buzz-13458-1381173489-8.jpg)

So when I was searching microphotography I was trying my dam hardest to get a ways from the usual shots of insects as I have seen them so much I am now starting to wonder what else people are doing with this type of photography.

Then I remembered about people taking photographs of snowflakes and this started me on a down slope of photographers. Though I feel like I have all ready wrote about one of them so I will just write about this new guy that I have found. Sadly I cannot find an actual website for him but it seems that his photographs have gotten reconnection for being unique and interesting. Ok so with a bit more searching I have found the place where he show cases his work, firstly the guy that I am looking at is called Andrew Osokin. What I like about this photographer is that he changes it up in terms of what he is taking a photograph of. He got exposure from taking photographs of frost/ snowflakes and they are just amazing. I love this photograph in particular as it just captures winter for me. I do not own a car but it reminds me of the early morning when getting to school in winter, you all ways had to have the warm water ready for the windows. There is much going on in the photograph with the setting up of it as the subject does all that work, you just need to get close to it to show the detail of it.

![Andrew Osokin](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02433/frost-big_2433027k.jpg)

Then this next photograph is of insects but it's not like the normal ones you see. What I like about this photograph most is the fact that it captures the snails in the home environment. I just feels like someone getting helped over a wall by a friend, which we as kids us to do daily. Then I like the different tonnes of colour that are in the photograph with the snails being in such contrast to what they are on. Then you have the use of focus in the photograph that is used perfectly as you can only really focus your eyes on the snails in the front. You then get this nice range of colour in the background that subtly says nature to me with the hint of red, green and brown.

Then the next photograph I like because it is all round a fantastic photograph. What I like most about this photograph is the use of focus that is on the flower. To me this makes the photograph all most look likes a painting with the sun penetrating the petals of the flower. Then I like the use of composition to show a tiny bit more of other flowers to ground the photograph.

![Andrew Osokin](http://www.lensart.ru/picturecontent-pid-1d201-et-7d79e89)

So I have all ready wrote about another one of his frost photographs but I just have to show this one as it is even better than the one I have all ready wrote about. I like that the frost is almost painting an image as to me I can see a rocky scenery with some trees in it. Then on the other hand it could a raging river after flash floods and its tearing the trees out from the homes. Or it might just be forest.  

![Andrew Osokin](http://www.lensart.ru/picturecontent-pid-2c0d3-et-98be92d)

This is a random photograph that I found on line but I really like it as the photographer is playing with the depth of the photograph. The for-ground and the back-ground or out of focus. You would do this if you want the views eyes to focus on a certain part of the photograph. In this case it is the top of the fork breaking the surface of the water. 

![Just of Google](https://experimental223.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pork.jpg)

I have realised that we are meant to be taking photographs of building so I thought I would look at a few of close up shots of buildings. The photograph below is something that I would like to achieve in my own photographs. As I have been up many times to Scrabo Tower and I know that the front door would look nice shot like this. There is even a view window that might look good if I line them up right. So I realised that the photograph that I was going to write about had a massive but subtle watermark on it. I have tried to find a similar one to it but this is the best that I could do, though I feel that this photograph would be better centred. This was taken by [Gertygiggles] (https://gertygiggles.wordpress.com/2013/01/26/cees-fun-photo-challenge-wood/), who is a budding photographer.

Finial Words
------------

So over all I really liked this module and would do it again. The reason I liked it so much is because I am all ready into photography and this rekindeld my passion for it for a while as it was cold outside and it was warm in side. I love the fact that you can train you eye to see all these interesting thing which you miss. All you need to do it tke your time. One you take your time your eyes will see the micosopic things that you would have other whys missed. So this is the main thing I am taking way from this modual. I want to soak in what amazing sights I see even if it is just a sunrise.
